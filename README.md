# Maze Solver 🏁🔍  

This Python project **generates and solves mazes**. It creates randomly generated mazes and then finds the optimal path from the start to the end.  

## Features ✨  

✅ **Maze Generation**: Uses algorithms like Recursive Backtracking (DFS) or Prim’s Algorithm to create unique mazes.  
✅ **Maze Solving**: Implements pathfinding algorithms such as BFS, DFS, and A* to find the shortest path.  
✅ **Visualization**: Displays the maze generation and solving process using `matplotlib` or `pygame`.  
✅ **Customizable**: Supports different maze sizes and complexity levels.  

## Installation 🚀  

1. Clone the repo:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Shaheryarkhalid/Maze_Solver.git  
   cd maze-solver
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script:  
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage 🏗️  

- Modify `config.py` to change maze size, algorithm settings, or visualization mode.  
- Choose different solving algorithms by passing parameters in `main.py`.  

## Algorithms Used ⚡  

### 🔹 Maze Generation  
- **Recursive Backtracking (DFS)** – Depth-first approach for carving paths.  
- **Prim’s Algorithm** – Randomized algorithm for creating complex mazes.  

### 🔹 Maze Solving  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** – Guarantees the shortest path.  
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** – Faster but not always optimal.  
- **A* Algorithm** – Heuristic-based pathfinding for efficiency.
